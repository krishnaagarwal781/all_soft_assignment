-   **API Service**: A centralized instance for making API calls (e.g., using Axios or Fetch) with authentication tokens in headers.
-   **Tag Service**: Manages fetching existing tags and saving new tags.
-   **File Service**: Provides functionalities for document upload, search, preview, and download.

## 🚀 Getting Started
